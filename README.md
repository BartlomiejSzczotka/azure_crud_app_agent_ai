- Azure-inspired color scheme

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- UUID for unique IDs
- CORS enabled
- JSON data storage (ready for Azure SQL integration)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BartlomiejSzczotka/azure_crud_app_agent_ai.git
   cd azure_crud_app_agent_ai
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server** (from the backend directory):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server will run on http://localhost:3001

2. **Start the frontend** (from the frontend directory):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   App will open in browser at http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. **Add Products**: Use the form to create new products with name, description, price, and category
2. **View Products**: All products are displayed in a responsive grid layout
3. **Edit Products**: Click the "Edit" button on any product card to modify it
4. **Delete Products**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a product (with confirmation)

## Azure Integration Ready

This application is structured to easily integrate with Azure services:

- **Azure App Service**: Deploy both frontend and backend
- **Azure SQL Database**: Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Alternative NoSQL database option
- **Azure Storage**: For file uploads and static assets
- **Azure Functions**: For serverless API endpoints

## Sample API Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "name": "Sample Product",
      "description": "This is a sample product",
